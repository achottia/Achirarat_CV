        <p> My research focuses on enhancing the efficiency of Molecular Communication 
        (MC) systems through rigorous analysis of Bit Error Rate (BER) in diffusion-based 
        channels. The inherently stochastic nature of molecular diffusion presents 
        significant challenges for reliable communication, particularly in analyzing 
        and optimizing system performance. My primary objective is to develop comprehensive 
        diffusion models that accurately characterize these stochastic processes, enabling 
        the design of more efficient MC systems. Specifically, this work will establish theoretical 
        frameworks to quantify and improve communication reliability in nanoscale environments 
        where traditional electromagnetic approaches are impractical. </p>

        <b>Optimization of Molecule Mixtures and Cross-Reactive Sensing Arrays in Molecular Communication</b>
        , <i> Supervised by </i> Bastian Heinlein, M.Sc. and Prof. Dr.-Ing. Vahid Jamali  <br>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract</b> : Molecular Communication (MC) is an emerging paradigm utilizing molecules as information carriers, with applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and biotechnology. 

        One promising research direction is Olfaction-Inspired MC (OMC), which is inspired by biological olfaction systems. OMC leverages cross-reactive sensing units like biological receptors or technical sensors, where the number of molecule types is higher than the number of receptor types. This enables the utilization of multiple molecule types in a single transmission, as molecular mixtures enhance transmission efficiency. However, at the same time, molecule mixtures also pose new challenges such as the selection of mixtures alphabets. Previous studies have explored mixture selection using a dissimilarity metric, which is despite its effectiveness, is computationally complex. 

        This thesis explores a simpler alternative approach using the Euclidean distance and evaluates two problem formulations: the Max-Min approach, which maximizes separability between mixtures, and the Repulsion-Based approach, inspired by natural particle interactions, which minimizes repulsive forces. Additionally, so-called priority messages are introduced to convey critical information with lower error rates than regular messages.

        Moreover, we evaluate algorithms to select suitable sensing units, ensuring strong detection performance while maintaining low complexity and cost constraints. In this regard, the Fast Binary Search (FBS) and Condition Number Minimization techniques are evaluated, proving significantly improves communication accuracy over random selection methods.

        This study has the potential to enhance diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and next-generation bio-communication networks. Future research will focus on refining optimization methods, enhancing validation processes, and improving receptor selection to enable scalable real-world applications.

        <b>Vehicle Datalogger</b>, <i> Supervised by </i> Asst.Prof. Dr. Supachai Vorapojpisut<br>
        <br>
        <b>Abstract</b> : The car is the most popular which need to be checked periodically. There are several
        methods to engine performance in which the most comfortable is to ask staffs at car service
        center. However, it is not convenient to go to there and the cost is expensive although it is
        just to use a tool to read from computer system in the car. So we have studied and developed  
        the vehicle data logger that reading the data from OBD-II in the real time, the device can
        gather the data saving in SD card and sending to the computer. So we can estimate engine
        performance and diagnostic problems before hand. In addition, we interested about the tuning
        car industry, so we studied the difference in digital marketing model between a major service
        shop and a small service shop both in web board and social network channels.
